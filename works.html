	<h3>Photography</h3>
	<p>I got my first camera, a SONY mini <abbr title = "single-lens reflex">SLR</abbr> camera, as my 12th birthday present. Over the years, I have travelled to 32 Chinese provinces and 2 countries outside China. I would always bring my camera with me on those trips and use it to capture moments I find beautiful or interesting. Street is my favirote theme of photography, because I love observing the details in society and keeping them in my photos. In the summer of 2022, my SONY camera broke down during my trip to Xinjiang province, so I switched to another mini SLR camera made by Olympus and have been using it ever since.</p>
	
	<p>I've picked out about 50 of my best photos for you to see. To make things easier, here are some <strong class="sub"><a class = "sub" href = "photosbycountry.html">maps</a></strong> directing you to the pictures I've taken in different parts of the world. You can also view the pictures by their <strong class="sub"><a class = "sub" href = "photosbycategory.html">categories</a></strong> if you want to. <br/> <em>&#40;please do, they are really cool&#41;</em></p>

	<h3>Videos</h3>
	<p>On my trips, I sometimes also create <abbr title = "video blogs">vlogs</abbr>. Here is one of them.</p>
