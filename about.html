	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p class="about">My legal Chinese name is Li Jinyue as in <em class="chinese">李今越</em>. I was born in a small town in Hubei Province on August 27th, 2004 and grew up in Wuhan, China. After my parents' divorce in 2015 I've been living in a small lakeside apartment with my mother and our two cats. On August 27th, 2022, my 18th birthday, I got on a 13-hour plane and landed in Madison, USA for the brand new chapter of my life -- college.</p>
